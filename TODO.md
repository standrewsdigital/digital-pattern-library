# To Do

## Infrastructure

- Write summary
- Write a README on how to get setup developing
- Write another piece about how to add a new pattern.
- Make patchwork contents (the list) automatically-generated.
- Add taxonomy for patterns (ie, pages, forms, galleries, call-to... ). This could be in the form of tags, categories, or something similar.
- Setup better CSS/JS for pattern library (rather than hard-coded in layout). Could we use the core JS/CSS?

## Coding Style Guide

* ~~Add a section to the patterns on coding style~~
* Write a draft coding style guide.


## Pattern development

* Transition all patterns to new format (see tile pattern for an example)
* (after tranisition) Remove pattern-bkp folder
* Finesse buttons for external-home pattern
* Update with official colors 
* Expand and document the accent color ideas (create a pattern?) d
