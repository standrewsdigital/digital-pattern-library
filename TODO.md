# To Do


## Infrastructure

- patchwork
  - Improve listing with pattern name and link to pattern documentation.
  - Fully automate so that new patterns are automatically listed.
- Add taxonomy for patterns.  
  This would allow us to group our patterns into things like page patterns, form patterns, ... Could implement this with Assemble's built in [tags or categories](http://assemble.io/docs/Collections.html) or a custom taxonomy.
- Improve the CSS/JS used for `patterns`.  
  Currently it's hard coded. It would probably be best to use the core CSS and JS as long as that wouldn't cause any conflicts. At at minimum, using a separate `doc.css` and `doc.js` might be helpful. Anywhere that we have documentation it could use these core files.


## Documentation

- ~~Write a draft README with installation and development instructions~~
- Write a draft About explaining the pattern library
- Write a draft Adding a pattern
- Write a draft CSS style guide
- Write a draft JS style guide


## Pattern development

- Transition all patterns to new format (see tile pattern for an example)
- (after tranisition) Remove pattern-bkp folder
- Finesse buttons for external-home pattern
- Update with official colors 
- Expand and document the accent color ideas (create a pattern?)
- Remove `patterns_bkp`
