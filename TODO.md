#To Do






## Infrastructure

- ~~Remove build and patterns folder since they are build dynamically.~~
- ~~Build README dynamically from About and Getting Started (create a getting started page)~~
- ~~Improve the CSS/JS used for `patterns` with a separate doc.css and doc.js~~
- ~~Link to https://github.com/sjparsons/handlebars-helper-asset/tree/relative-links instead of the standard [handlebars-helper-asset](https://github.com/helpers/handlebars-helper-asset).~~
- ~~Main index: use bootstrap now for layout.~~
- **Add taxonomy for patterns.**  This would allow us to group our patterns into things like page patterns, form patterns. Implement this with Assemble's built in [tags or categories](http://assemble.io/docs/Collections.html) or a custom taxonomy.

- Patchwork
  - Improve listing with pattern name and link to pattern documentation.
  - Improve CSS for header on Patchwork (some issues here)
  - Fully automate so that new patterns are automatically listed.
- Add comments to top/bottom of each pattern definition
- Add comments to top(bottom?) of each pattern's scss file.

- Create a grunt task / script to create a pattern.

## Documentation

- ~~Write a draft README with installation and development instructions~~
- ~~Write a draft About explaining the pattern library~~
- Getting Started: add note about dependency on Ruby and compass gem.
- **Write a draft "Adding a pattern"** Some things to include:
  - Requirement elements of a pattern, files to add, naming conventions.
  - Github flow guidelines â€“- requirements for code reviews


- Write a draft "CSS style guide"
- Write a draft "JS style guide"
- Ensure that all documentation follows the [house style](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/policy/styleguides/housestyle/).
- Create doc about accent colors. Specify the patterns that are 'accent'-able. Perhaps by using a taxonomy.

## Pattern development

- ~~Transition all patterns to new format (see tile pattern for an example)~~ (almost at least)
- Add comments to beginning and end of all patterns.
- (after tranisition) Remove pattern-bkp folder
- Finesse buttons for external-home pattern
- Update with official colors 
- Expand and document the accent color ideas (create a pattern?)
- Go through `base.js` and separate out into patterns if appropriate.
- Add a page meta pattern. (might also somewhere include the requirement to have a skip to navigation button)
