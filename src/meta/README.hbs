## Deploying

To deploy your code you can use the two grunt commands

```
grunt deploy-core --tag=<version-num>
```

```
grunt deploy-docs --tag=<version-num>
```

Replacing `<version-num>` with the appopriate version. For example:

```
grunt deploy-core --tag=0.1.2
```

```
grunt deploy-docs --tag=0.1.2
```

In order for the commands to work you will need to create a file called `.ftppass` and include your FTP credentials in it. It should have the following form:

```
{
  "core": {
    "username": "your-username",
    "password": "password"
  },
  "docs": {
    "username": "your-username",
    "password": "password"
  }
}
```
