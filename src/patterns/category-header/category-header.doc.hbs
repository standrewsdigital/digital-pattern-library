title: Category header
pattern: category-header
examples:
- name: image-background-with-transparent-overlay
- name: solid-background
- name: old-category-header
---

<div class="alert alert-info">The category header pattern has been updated so that the transparent overlay is now added using <code>&lt;div class="transparent-overlay"&gt;</code> rather then using the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> element, as it was previously â€“ see old-category-header example below. This support will be removed at some point, so please do not use the old category header markup.</div>

<p>The category header pattern contains the name of the current category or section and a link to it. In the case of <a href="../../examples/web-app.html">web applications</a> the name of the web application is shown in the category header.</p>

<h2>Background image template</h2>
<p>So it may be positioned reliably across a variety of screen sizes, the background image must use the Photoshop template below.</p>
<p><img src="{{asset "docs/images/patterns/category-header/category-header-photoshop-template.jpg"}}" style="width:100%; max-width:992px;"></p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>What background image should I use?</strong>
    	<ul>
        	<li>Due to the main focus of this pattern being the header text, the background image shouldn't be overly complicated. The background image is used to enhance the visual identity of the page.</li>
        	<li>Photographs of the St Andrews skyline including plenty view of the horizon are recommened.</li>
        	<li>Photographs including people are discouraged for category headers.</li>
    	</ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Must be used directly below the header and before the navigation bar.</li>
    <li>Web applications typically show a solid colour background, rather than the transparent background image.</li>
    <li>Background images must be <code>1905px &times; 120px</code> and created using the background image template (see above).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Options</h2>

<ul>
	<li>An image with a transparent colour overlay or a solid colour can be used for the background.</li>
</ul>
