INSTRUCTIONS, PT.1

START HERE...

1. The name of the directory should be the same as the pattern name (in this example `dummy-pattern`), and the name of this file.

2. Give the pattern a title. This should be human-readable and may contain spaces.

3. Change the names of the examples above. These are in the /examples directory. Use descriptive names rather than example-1, example-2, etc. It makes it much easier

Now edit the `dummy-pattern.hbs` file.
