    "paragraph": "Every day is taco ipsum tuesday. Give me tacos, or give me death. Add in a few el Pastor with guac and diced onions. Fish tacos: lettuce or cabbage, pico de gallo, avocado and a sour cream or citrus/mayonnaise sauce, all placed on top of a corn or flour tortilla. Shrimp tacos are tasty tacos! CARNE ASADA!! Itâ€™s a wonderful morning for breakfast tacos. Add in a few el Pastor with guac and diced onions. Say taco one more time. Um, Tabasco? No thanks, do you have any Cholula? Can you put some peppers and onions on that?"
