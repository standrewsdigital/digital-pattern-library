title: Tabs pattern
---

<p>The tabs pattern is a dynamic pattern that shows related content in tabs, but that doesn't need to be seen simultaneously.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use tabs when you want to show content that is related but isn't meant to be compared.</li>
    <li>There should be between 2 and 5 tabs, as long as there isn't more than 1 row.</li>
    <li>Tabs are for text content only.</li>
    <li>This pattern should only be used in the main container, not in the aside.</li>
</ul>
