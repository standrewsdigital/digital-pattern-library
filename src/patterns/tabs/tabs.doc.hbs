title: Tabs
---

<p>The tabs pattern organises similar pieces of content that do not need to be shown to the user simultaneously. Users can move between tabs to see each piece of content</p>

<h3>Rules for tabs</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Use tabs when you want to show content that is related but isn't meant to be compared by the user.</li>
    <li>There should be between two and five tabs, as long as there isn't more than one row.</li>
    <li>Tabs must only be used for text-based content.</li>
    <li>This pattern should only be used in the main body of text, not in the aside.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Options available</h3>
