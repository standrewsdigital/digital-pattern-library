title: Gallery

<div class="alert alert-danger">This pattern is backwards-compatible with previous implementations of the gallery pattern &ndash; see the old gallery option below, which used the jQuery theatre plugin. Please do not use the old gallery markup because support for this will be removed at some point.</div>

<p>The gallery pattern demonstrates a method of displaying a large number of images on a page and makes use of the <a href="http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2">Lightbox JavaScript library</a> to view the images in an immersive experience.</p>

<h3>Rules for the gallery</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Gallery images must be in landscape orientation.</li>
  <li>Full size gallery images must be 1280 &times; 960 pixels. This resolution must never be exceeded.</li>
  <li>All images must have an aspect ratio of 4:3. This is the typical aspect ratio for photographs.</li>
  <li>If an image's resolution is lower than 1280 &times; 960 pixels, then the image must have an aspect ratio of 4:3 at its highest native resolution.</li>
  <li>Thumbnail images are not automatically generated from the full image and must be created separately.</li>
  <li>Thumbnail images must be 360 &times; 240 pixels.</li>
  <li>A gallery must only be used within the main body of a page.</li>
  <li>A page may contain multiple galleries.</li>
  <li>Use <code>data-lightbox="[gallery name]"</code> to group images together for each gallery.</li>
</ul>
