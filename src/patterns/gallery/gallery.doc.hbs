title: Gallery

<div class="alert alert-info">The gallery pattern is backwards-compatible with previous implementations used on the University of St Andrews website &ndash; see old-gallery example below, which used the jQuery theatre plugin. This support will be removed at some point, so please do not use the old accordion markup.</div>

The gallery pattern demonstrates a method of displaying a large number of images on a page and makes use of the <a href="http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2">lightbox</a> jQuery plugin to view the images in an immersive experience.


<ul>
  <li>Use this pattern whenever you wish to present a large number of images in small form that link to a larger, more immersive experience.</li>
</ul>
