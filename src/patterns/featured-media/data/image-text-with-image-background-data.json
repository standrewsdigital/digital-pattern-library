I feel that the flexibility of the degree programmes, and the support for any difficulties you may have along the way, is what makes a degree at St Andews unlike many others. Students encouraged to embark on an independent journey of academic and self-discovery whilst having access to a network of academic, social and welfare support.\"</p><p><strong>Francesca</strong> (Tadworth, Surrey, England)</p></div>"
