It is much drier than the western parts of the country but it is prone to strong winds blowing in off the North Sea.</p><p>One of the most popular aspects of St Andrews is its beautiful beaches. Enjoy a quiet thoughtful stroll or a bracing walk with friends along the two miles of the West Sands, or go surfing, sailing or sea kayaking on the waves of the East Sands. You can also experience a spectacular walk to the end of the stone pier, where you will find historic views of the twelfth century cathedral and castle.</p>"
