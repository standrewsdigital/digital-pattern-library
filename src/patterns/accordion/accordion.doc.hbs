<div class="alert alert-info">The accordion pattern is backwards-compatible with previous implementations used on the Study at St Andrews website. See example 2. This support will be removed at some point, so DO NOT use the markup in example 2.</div>

	<p>The accordion pattern presents an expandable and collapsible section of content. Accordions shorten pages and reduce scrolling, but they require users to click on topic headings to find information. Therefore, accordions should be used sparingly and with care.

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Accordions should not be used when your audience needs most or all of the content on the page to answer their questions. Better to show all page content at once when the use case supports it. In such cases, don't worry about page length.</li>
	<li>Accordions should be used when users only need a few key pieces of content on a single page.</li>
	<li>Accordions can be used anywhere in a content section.</li>
	<li>Cannot be used on a home page.</li>
	<li>Cannot be used in an aside.</li>
</ul>
