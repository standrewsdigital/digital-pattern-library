<blockquote>
	<p>Font Awesome gives you scalable vector icons that can instantly be customized â€” size, color, drop shadow, and anything that can be done with the power of CSS.</p> 
	<footer>Font Awesome website</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>We use Font Awesome icons to accent elements on webpages and web applications. See below for examples and the list of approved icons.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ul>
   <li>Use icons to accent exisiting elements</li>
   <li>Basic functionality CAN use only icons</li>
   <li>Complex interations should use text rather than icons</li>
</ul>
