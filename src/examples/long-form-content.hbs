            <h2>Light Box</h2>

            <p class="lead">Poet Robert Crawford and photographer Norman McBeath partner to celebrate the 2015 UNESCO International Year of Light.</p>

            <p>When 2015 was announced as the UNESCO International Year of Light, the news stoked a spark in the brain of academic and poet Robert Crawford. Having long been inspired by light and science — his 1990 poetry debut, <em><a href="">A Scottish Assembly</a></em> weaves together lines on light and love and incorporates tongue-twisting scientific references — the spark was fanned into an idea of an artistic collaboration of poet, photographer and physicist.</p>

            <p>That idea grew into a collaborative project between Crawford and Edinburgh photographer Norman McBeath, whose striking portraits play off of the intricacies of light and shadow, with each inspired by contemporary physicists whose work centres on light.</p>

            <h2>The spark</h2>

            <p>In late 2013, the United Nations (<abbr>UN</abbr>) announced that 2015 would officially be the International Year of Light and Light-based technologies. The UN recognised the power of light, and aimed to raise global awareness about how light-based technologies can provide solutions to global challenges in energy, education, agriculture and health. From the day that the Year of Light was announced, plans began for events and projects across the world.</p>

            <blockquote>
            Light has revolutionized medicine, opened up international communication via the Internet, and continues to be central to linking cultural, economic and political aspects of the global society.
            </blockquote>

            <p>The announcement of that 2015 would be the Year of Light was greeted with excitement in St Andrews. Light is valued in the town; from the physicists in the Organic Semiconductor Optoelectronics research group through to the students lucky enough to catch the Northern Lights flickering over the cathedral on cool Scottish nights. Professor Robert Crawford saw opportunity within the announcement; opportunity to bring together the scientists whose discoveries are further lighting the world along with a photographer who documents the world through light and shadow, and a group of poets inspired by the two.</p>

            <p>Professor Crawford’s had good links with researchers in the University’s School of Physics, and knew that the team there had discovered / produced a light emitting substance. He wondered whether this substance could give off enough light to be used to expose photographic paper — creating art out of light.</p>

            <p>The cost of the material deemed the project impossible, but the idea of using chemicals to enhance photography had taken hold in Professor Crawford’s mind.</p>

            <h2>The art</h2>

            <h3>Light Box</h3>

            <p>To explain why he chose to use haikus, Crawford described it as the poetic form which comes closest to the click of a camera shutter. The history of photography is also important to the genesis of Light Box — in 1840, St Andrews was the first town in the world to be “thoroughly documented” by photography, said Crawford, and this innovative spirit continues today with the work of the physics research group.</p>

            <h2>Aton exhibit</h2>

            <p>Hien Nguyen developed a new form of synthesised coumarin to be used in photography. Coumarin was used in the Aton exhibit and represented a ‘world first’, in that it incorporated this newly synthesised form which has never before been used in a photographic process.</p>

            <p>The coumarin was incorporated into the photographic process so that when the image was placed under a black light, the image emits light of its own. However, as the coumarin degrades over time, so does the amount of light that the photograph emits; a temporary addition to the artwork.</p>

            <h3>Further collaboration</h3>

            <p>Three postgraduate poets (on the MLitt Creative Writing course) — Helen Nicholson, Amanda Merritt and Tristram Fane Saunders.</p>

            <p>Wrote poems inspired by the research done in St Andrews, illustrated by appropriate photographs by town and gown photographers.</p>

            <p>Including one of noctolucent clouds and polytunnels used by Nicholson for her work, Light Fantastic.</p>

            <p>Merritt used a photograph of flowers for her musings on light and the body.</p>

            <p>Fane Saunders wrote about bees — the “flying biosensors” used to detect unexploded bombs in the Balkans by “smelling” TNT in pollen and recording their find on a special plastic film which is sensitive to the electromagnetic charge on the bees.</p>
