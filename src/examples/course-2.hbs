			<p>You will enter the gateway programme with a specific Honours degree route in mind, and you will take modules relevant for that programme.</p>  

			<p>During the gateway programme, you will be highly supported to prepare you to progress to degree-level study. You will have a designated Adviser of Studies who will provide support and guidance on all academic matters. You will also have a single point of contact with the Universityâ€™s Admissions team who will be able to signpost and provide guidance on where and when to seek help should the need arise.</p> 

			<p>During the programme, you will take the standard compulsory sub-honours modules for the degree you intend to complete, as well as additional subjects from the full range of modules offered in the Faculty of Arts. See module information, teaching format and assessment for different Honours degrees on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/">course pages</a>.</p> 

			<p>You will also be required to attend a peer-led tutorial each week in your main degree subjects.</p>  

			<p>At the end of the second year, if you have met all the academic requirements for your chosen Honours route, you will progress to junior Honours (typically the third year of a four-year Honours course). If you do not meet the requirements, you may be able to progress to a <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/">General degree route</a>.</p>
