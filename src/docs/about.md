title: About the pattern library
---

### Audiences

The digital pattern library has three main audiences, built around the following user stories:

### 1. General users

General users will load pages in their browser, using the core CSS and JavaScript from the pattern library. Pages they access should all have the same look and feel.

* As an end user I want the University website to be displayed regardless of platform or browser so that I can easily navigate and use the content.

### 2. Web developers

Developers outwith the digital communications team build applications or websites using the core CSS and JavaScript. These developers need to know what the official patterns are and how to use them.

* As a web developer I want clear documentation about how, when and where to use design patterns so that there is a consistency across the applications and websites that I develop.

### 3. Digital communications team

The core team develops and designs the pattern library and uses it to build digital assets. The team needs a central place to work on, test and document the design patterns.

* As a member of the digital communications team I want a test-driven approach to developing websites/web applications so that new patterns are quality assured.
* As a member of the digital communications team I want the digital pattern library to be stored in a central code repository so that I may collaborate with other developers.
* As a member of the digital communications team I want the digital pattern library to be stored in a central code repository so that I may version control the code (and roll back if required).

## Deliverables

1. **Core CSS and JavaScript** These are found in the `build` folder of the repository; they are also published to a central location.
2. **Documentation** The `patterns` folder includes documentation about each pattern available in the pattern library, examples of each one, and a browsable patchwork of all the patterns. In addition, you will also find CSS and JavaScript coding style guides, and other information.
3. **Pattern tests** The core team can use the examples and patchwork in the `patterns` folder as a way to implement pattern-driven development, which is a translation of test-driven development to design patterns.
