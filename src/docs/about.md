title: About the pattern library
---

The pattern library has three main audiences:

1. **General users** who will load pages using the core CSS and JS from the pattern library. Pages they access should all have the same look and feel.
2. **Developers outside our team** who build applications or websites using our core CSS and JS. These developers needs to know what the official patterns are and how to use them. 
3. The **core team** develops and designs the pattern library and uses it to build digital assets. Our team needs a central place to work on, test and document our design patterns.

There are three main deliverables corresponding to the audiences:

1. **Core CSS and JS.** These are found in the `build` folder of the repository. They are also published to a central location.
2. **Documentation.** The `patterns` folder includes documentation about each pattern available in the pattern library, examples of each one, and a browsable patchwork of all the patterns. In addition, you will also find CSS and JS coding style guides, and other information.
3. **Pattern tests.** The core team can use the examples and patchwork in the `patterns` folder as a way to implement pattern-driven-development, which is a translation of test-driven-development to design patterns.
