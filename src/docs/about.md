title: About the pattern library
two-thirds: true
lead: The digital pattern library (DPL) is a central repository for patterns used on the Universityâ€™s website and other digital products. A pattern is a single element of user interface design. The DPL includes the source code for each pattern, rules for using the pattern, and working examples.

## Audiences

The digital pattern library has three main audiences, built around the following user stories:

### General users

General users load pages in their browser, using the core CSS and JavaScript from the pattern library. Pages they access should all have the same look and feel.

* As an end user I want the University website to display regardless of platform or browser so that I can easily navigate and use the content.

### Web developers

Developers outwith the Digital Communications team build applications or websites using the core CSS and JavaScript from the DPL. These developers need to know what the official patterns are and how to use them.

* As a web developer I want clear documentation about how, when and where to use design patterns so that there is a consistency across the applications and websites that I develop.

### Digital Communications team

The team develops and designs the pattern library and uses it to build digital assets. The team needs a central place to work on, test and document the design patterns.

* As a member of the Digital Communications team I want a test-driven approach to developing websites and web applications so that new patterns are quality assured.
* As a member of the Digital Communications team I want the digital pattern library to be stored in a central code repository so that I may collaborate with other developers.
* As a member of the Digital Communications team I want the digital pattern library to be stored in a central code repository so that I may version control the code (and roll back if required).

### Content creators, editors and moderators
Users creating and publishing content on a website that uses the DPL need a central place to review how the various patterns should be used.
* As a content creator and editor I want a single reference point explaining how each of the content items in my CMS is intended to be used.
* As an editor and moderator I want a single reference point explaining the rules for each pattern to let me quality assure the content before it is published.

## Deliverables

* **Core CSS and JavaScript** These are found in the 'build' folder of the repository; they are also published to a separate server to be used in a dependent website or web application.
* **Documentation** The 'patterns' folder includes documentation about each pattern available in the pattern library, examples of each one and guidance on their use.

## Browsers supported
The Digital Communications team is committed to making the University website and web applications as usable as possible, irrespective of browser or platform (see the [accessibility](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/digital-standards/accessibility/) section within digital standards for more information). The team uses the following baseline of browsers to actively support and test against.

### Desktop
Generally, the digital pattern library supports the current major desktop releases of: 

* Chrome
* Edge
* Firefox
* Internet Explorer (version 11 only)
* Safari

### Mobile
The digital pattern library is tested on the following current mobile releases of:

* Android
* Chrome
* iOS
* Chrome
* Safari

### What "support" means

Support does not mean that every browser will display exactly the same thing. There are many variables (device, operating system, browser, screen size, etc.) that influence how a web page is displayed. 

The priorities of the digital pattern library are availability and accessibility.
