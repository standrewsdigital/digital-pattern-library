title: JavaScript dependencies
---

The Pattern Library uses code from the following packages. By default, all of these dependencies are built into our core files. However, the pattern library also provides a pattern-only version of the JavaScript file that does not include jQuery, Bootstrap JS and other external JavaScript libraries. If you use that version then you need to include these dependencies manually:


* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (v1.11.0)
* jQuery [Big Target](https://github.com/leevigraham/jquery-bigTarget.js/)
* jQuery [FitVids](https://github.com/davatron5000/FitVids.js) (v1.1)
* jQuery [FitTexts](https://github.com/davatron5000/FitText.js) (v1.2)
* jQuery [Theatre](https://bitbucket.org/st-andrews/jquery-theatre) (v1.0.1)
* [Respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) (v1.4.0)
* [Bootstrap-Sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass) (v3.3.1)
* [Enquire.js](https://github.com/WickyNilliams/enquire.js) (v2.1.2)

## Supported additional packages

These packages are supported by not required.

* [jQuery DataTables](http://www.datatables.net/) (v1.10.5) is supported and we provide additional JavaScript and CSS to match the pattern library. See [Data tables](datatables.html) for more information.
