            <p>The digital pattern library (DPL) is a comprehensive new resource designed to offer tools and support to university colleagues designing or developing new web pages and other digital outputs.</p>
            <p>Created and curated by the Universityâ€™s <a href="http://digitalcommunications.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/about/">digital communications team</a>, the digital pattern library is an evolving set of design patterns underpinning a new digital approach for St Andrews, built collaboratively and tested with the people who use our products.</p>
            <p>Its purpose is to ensure a consistent user experience, look and feel for all new digital products at the University of St Andrews. It follows the best-practice design principles of the digital communications team, is version controlled via GitHub and is platform agnostic.</p>

                <h3>Kick-off meeting</h3>
                 <div>
                    <p>All developers (including external agencies or partners) who wish to use the DPL to build a product must first organise a kick-off meeting with the digital communications team. It is advisable to do this as soon as possible near the start of your project (within the appraise or define stages).</p>
                    <p>At this meeting, rules, responsibilities and sign-off gateways will be agreed. These include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Information architecture (for webpages);</li>
                        <li>Workflows (for web applications);</li>
                        <li>Adherence to digital standards, including user-centred design, content management, URL policy, house style, and corporate identity;</li>
                        <li>Training.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>At this meeting, we will ask for a clear written commitment that no new product using the DPL will go live without the explicit, written sign-off by the digital communications team.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>To ensure design integrity and consistency of experience for our website users we will ask you to agree that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>New patterns must be created only by developers working directly alongside the digital communications team;</li>
                        <li>No patterns or elements (such as colours) in the DPL may be edited without first liaising with the digital communications team;</li>
                        <li>CSS or JavaScript must not be used to overrule DPL elements, patterns, fonts, etc.;</li>
                        <li>Developers using the DPL must not fork the version controlled repository.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Before going live to a production environment with a new website or application, the digital communications team will be involved in a final quality assurance process.</p>
                    <p>Once explicit and written sign-off has been given by the digital communications team the website or web application may be launched, subject to other University deployment guidelines.</p>
