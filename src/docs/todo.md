## Infrastructure

- Add comments to top/bottom of each pattern definition
- Add comments to top(bottom?) of each pattern's scss file.
- Move code for generating examples and related to the template for a pattern doc.
- Add descriptive titles to the example pages.
- Test including example pages in the 
- Get the patterns in alphabetical order

- **Add taxonomy for patterns.**  This would allow us to group our patterns into things like page patterns, form patterns. Implement this with Assemble's built in [tags or categories](http://assemble.io/docs/Collections.html) or a custom taxonomy.

- Patchwork
  - Improve listing with pattern name and link to pattern documentation.
  - Improve CSS for header on Patchwork (some issues here)
  - Fully automate so that new patterns are automatically listed.
- Add comments to top/bottom of each pattern definition
- Add comments to top(bottom?) of each pattern's scss file.

- Create a grunt task / script to create a pattern.


## Documentation

- Getting Started: add note about dependency on Ruby and compass gem.
- **Write a draft "Adding a pattern"** Some things to include:
  - Requirement elements of a pattern, files to add, naming conventions.
  - Github flow guidelines â€“- requirements for code reviews
- Write a draft "CSS style guide"
- Write a draft "JS style guide"
- Create doc about accent colors. Specify the patterns that are 'accent'-able. Perhaps by using a taxonomy.
- Ensure that all documentation follows the [house style](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/policy/styleguides/housestyle/).
- Create doc about accent colors. Specify the patterns that are 'accent'-able. Perhaps by using a taxonomy.

## Pattern development

- Add comments to beginning and end of all patterns.
- (after tranisition) Remove pattern-bkp folder
- Finesse buttons for external-home pattern
- Update with official colors 
- Expand and document the accent color ideas (create a pattern?)
- Go through `base.js` and separate out into patterns if appropriate.
