To Do


* Transition all patterns to new format (see tile pattern for an example)
* (after tranisition) Remove unnecessary .html files in /src/
* Update samples to pull in the new directory structure of files in /build/
* Generate a list of patterns dynamically for an index page.
* Create a basic header / footer for pattern that will give some easy of browsing around.
* Implement Live Reload for pattern and sample pages.

* Finesse buttons for external-home pattern
* Update with official colors 
* Expand and document the accent color ideas (create a pattern?)
