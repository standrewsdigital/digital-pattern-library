## 1. Introduction

The DPL is used to create both external (outside the University of St Andrews domain) and internal web applications and web pages. It follows the design principles of the digital communications team. The code in the DPL is version controlled via GitHub. It is a content management system (CMS) and system agnostic.



## 2. Getting started

See the [set up](https://github.com/standrewsdigital/digital-pattern-library/blob/master/SETUP.md) guide for prerequisites and how to install the DPL.




## 3. Running the tests

When grunt is run it takes the code from the `src` folder and creates documentation in the `docs` folder and code (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) in the `core` folder. Any errors found during production are reported to allow issues to be resolved.




## 4. Deployment

Pull-requests are made and the code peer-reviewed before merging with the master branch. In order to make the code available to web applications and web sites, the documentation and code is deployed by the digital communications team to two locations:

* Documentation to the [digital pattern library website](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/dpl/).
* Code to [http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~dpl/x.x.x/](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~dpl/x.x.x/).




## 5. Built with

* Bootstrap
* JQuery
* Node.js
* Grunt
* Compass




## 6. Contributing

Developers using the DPL should not fork the code in GitHub. No patterns or elements (such as colours) in the DPL may be edited without liaising with the digital communications team. This is the case in both the DPL and in any content management system; patterns should not be modified in any manner. Do not use CSS to overrule DPL elements, patterns, fonts etc. All code written must follow the digital communications team’s [code standards](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/digital-standards/service-manual/code-standards/). Rules on all patterns must be adhered to - if in doubt, please ask.

New patterns may only be created by developers working directly alongside the digital communications team.

See [contributing to the pattern library](https://github.com/standrewsdigital/digital-pattern-library/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for further details.

Commit messages must follow the [commit message style guide](https://github.com/standrewsdigital/digital-code-style-guide/blob/master/commit-messages.md).




## 7. Versioning

The dpl versioning follows [semantic versioning](https://github.com/standrewsdigital/digital-pattern-library/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#3-versioning).




## 8. Authors

The digital pattern library (DPL) is a resource created and owned by the University of St Andrews [digital communications team](http://digitalcommunications.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/). 




## 9. License

If you wish to use the DPL and you are a member of staff at the University of St&nbsp;Andrews, you must liaise with the digital communications team for access and training. Any member of staff using the DPL will be expected to attend the fortnightly DPL developers’ meeting on a regular basis.

External agencies or partners who wish to use the DPL must request access from the digital communications team. Access to the DPL to external partners is granted on a case by case basis.

All users of the DPL must have an understanding of [user-centred design](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/digital-standards/service-manual/user-centred), and keep up to date with amendments to the [digital communications team service manual](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/digital-standards/service-manual/).

New web applications and webpages designed using the digital pattern library must be approved by the digital communications team before they are deployed to a production environment.

All users who wish to use the DPL to build a product must first organise a kick-off meeting with the digital communications team. At this meeting rules and responsibilities will be explained. Once they have been introduced to and understand the DPL and want to continue to use it they will be required to sign a Memorandum of Understanding.

The Memorandum of Understanding will set out clear sign off gateways, which require users to share the information architecture (for web pages) and/or workflow (for web apps) as well as plans for content management with the digital communications team before the DPL is used to build or prototype a product. 

Once the IA or workflow has been agreed, the product must meet the relevant [URL policy](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/digital-standards/service-manual/links/). All products using any element of the DPL must conform to the [house style](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/digital-standards/service-manual/house-style/), [content standards](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/digital-standards/service-manual/content-management/standards/) and [corporate identity policy](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/digital-standards/service-manual/corporate-identity/) of the University.

A clear commitment must be given that no new product using the DPL will go live without the explicit, written sign-off by the digital communications team.

In turn, the digital communications team will provide advice and support for use of the DPL.
